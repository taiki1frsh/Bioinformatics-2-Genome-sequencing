# Programs for bioinfomatics course in Coursera

The programs are made to solve problems in [Genome sequencing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/genome-sequencing)of bioinfomatics course of Coursera in Rust.   
The reason why I write in rustlang is generally faster and more handful to big data like complete genome sequence than Python which is usually used in bioinfomatics for many reasons.    
I write down the explanation of important functions under the directory, maybe. So check out more info by digging into each dir.

If all tests in a directory can be passed, it means that main functions to solve the problems in that course are fine.
To test them, type it under the directory
'cargo test'
  

## Contribution

I am very immatured in terms of writting stylish and efficient code.   
So, if you're interested in this work (to write programs for bioinfomatics course on Coursera), feel free to contribute!
I need you sincerely.   
There is no restrict rules of course, by the way.
